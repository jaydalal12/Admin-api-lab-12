# GigaSpaces Admin API 

## Lab Goals

**1.** Explore about the Admin APIâ€™s capabilities <br />
**2.** Learn to capture the alerts using the Admin APIs<br />

## Lab Description
In this lab we will focus on GigaSpaces Admin API.<br>
To better know its capabilities you will use GigaSpaces Admin API for your convenience.

### 1	Start gs-agent

1.1 Navigate to %XAP_HOME/bin <br />
        
1.2 Start demo space:

    ./gs.sh demo
    
#### 1 Relocate

 * `cd Relocate` 
 * `./build.sh`  
 * `./admin.groovy.sh` 

1.1 The Admin script will test the runtime 6 time (then the scripts exits, also number of times to test can be configured in admin.groovy.sh max_time_to_check flag)<br />
1.2 Looking for GSC were UsedHeapSize is more than 50MB (can be changed from admin.groovy.sh heap_size_check flag)<br />
1.3 If such GSC it checks if there are more than one PU instance deployed on that GSC.<br />
1.4 If such GSC is found the script looks for an empty GSC to relocate one of the Pus to.<br />
1.5 If it founds an empty GSC then the PU first PU instance will be relocated else a new GSC will be started with AdminApiZone in zones & then the first PU instance will be relocated.<br />
1.6 It is done till each GSC contains only one PU instance.<br />
1.7 Between each check the script sleeps for 20 seconds.<br />
